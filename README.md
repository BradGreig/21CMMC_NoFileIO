# 21CMMC_NoFileIO

****************** 

Now outdated as it reflects the old 21CMMC (new version at https://github.com/BradGreig/21CMMC). However, still relevant for reference on how to avoid File I/O 

******************

A cleaner (but slower) version of 21CMMC. Please go here (https://github.com/BradGreig/21CMMC) for the easier to use, faster, more supported version 

It is 50% slower due to the C and Python interfacing. This version is included as an alternate if file I/O becomes an issue or if you are experienced in interfacing C and Python may be able to improve over the version I provide and improve its efficiency

For test boxes, please go to https://github.com/BradGreig/21CMMC and obtain from there
