# 21CMMC_NoFileIO
A more advanced (but slower) version of 21CMMC. Please go here (https://github.com/BradGreig/21CMMC) for the easier to use, faster, more supported version 

It is 50% slower due to the C and Python interfacing. This version is included as an alternate if file I/O becomes an issue or if you are experienced in interfacing C and Python may be able to improve over the version I provide and improve its efficiency
